# Speed Camera Warning App

This is a Flutter-based Android application that predicts the nearest speed camera based on GPS data. The app is a conversion of an existing Python project into Dart for better compatibility with Android development.

## Features
- Predicts the nearest speed camera coordinates.
- Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- User-friendly interface built with Flutter.
