# Speed Camera Warning App

This is a Flutter-based Android application that predicts the nearest speed camera based on GPS data. The app is a conversion of an existing Python project into Dart for better compatibility with Android development.

## Features
- Predicts the nearest speed camera coordinates.
- Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- User-friendly interface built with Flutter.
- Real-time dashboard displays current direction and average bearing.

## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Use `flutter run` to launch the app on an emulator or device.

## GPX Simulation
For development and testing without relying on a real GPS receiver, the app can
replay coordinates from a GPX track. On the **Actions** page press **Start (GPX)**
to launch the app using the sample track located at `gpx/nordspange_tr2.gpx`.

## Cloud data and rate limiting

The application downloads speed camera and construction zone information from a
cloud service. Access to this data requires a valid Google service account JSON
file placed at `python/service_account/<your-service-account>.json`. Without this
file the log will show messages like `Service account file not found` and the
app will fall back to the limited data bundled with the repository.

To avoid excessive network traffic the lookahead requests are rate limited. The
interval for speedâ€‘camera downloads is controlled by the
`dosAttackPreventionIntervalDownloads` variable in
`lib/rectangle_calculator.dart` (default `30` seconds). Construction area
queries use a separate `constructionAreaLookupInterval` (default `120`
seconds) to further reduce server load. Adjust these values if you need more
frequent updates during development.

## Project Structure
- `lib/`: Contains the main application code.
- `assets/`: Stores static assets like images and JSON files.
- `test/`: Includes unit and widget tests.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the app.
